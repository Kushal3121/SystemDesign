// Imagine you go to an IKEA store:
//     - If you want to furnish your living room, you buy a set → sofa + table + lamp.
//     - If you want to furnish your bedroom, you buy a set → bed + wardrobe + nightstand.
//     - You don’t mix them up — each factory produces a family of related products.
// Abstract Factory provides an interface to create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

// Technical Importance:
//     - Used when you need to create groups of related objects that must work together.
//     - Good for cross-platform apps:
//         - Example: MacOS UI vs Windows UI → both have Button, Checkbox, Menu, but look different.
