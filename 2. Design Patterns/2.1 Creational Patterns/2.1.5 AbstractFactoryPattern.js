// Imagine you go to an IKEA store:
//     - If you want to furnish your living room, you buy a set → sofa + table + lamp.
//     - If you want to furnish your bedroom, you buy a set → bed + wardrobe + nightstand.
//     - You don’t mix them up — each factory produces a family of related products.
// Abstract Factory provides an interface to create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
