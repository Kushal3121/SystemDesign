// Imagine you subscribe to a YouTube channel.
//     - Whenever the channel uploads a new video, you get a notification.
//     - You don’t need to keep checking manually — the channel *notifies you automatically*.
//     - That’s the Observer Pattern!

// Technical Importance:
//     - Defines a one-to-many relationship between objects.
//     - When one object changes state (Subject), all its dependents (Observers) are notified.
//     - Used heavily in event-driven systems (GUIs, stock tickers, chat apps, etc.)
